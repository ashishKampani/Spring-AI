/*  With a Record, you can define the data fields in one line of code,
    instead of having to define a constructor and getter/setter methods for
    each field in a class. This makes your code
    shorter, easier to read, and less prone to errors.*/


/*    Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
    Records are a good fit for DTOs, which are used to transfer data between different parts of an application.
    With records, you can define DTOs with just a few lines of code, reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.*/
